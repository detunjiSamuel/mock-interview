## Info 
A platform for new graduates to be interview-ready and confident in their interview skills.

I recently began interviewing and realized how poorly I performed when it came to explaining my reasons for applying. I either sounded too scripted at times or just rambled aimlessly. I am building this platform for people like me who want to improve their interview skills. This will be a resource where new grads can access interview tips, common questions with sample answers, and a virtual mock interview tool. The goal is to help young professionals feel prepared and assured when interviewing, so they can effectively communicate their qualifications. With the right coaching and practice, any new graduate can become an eloquent and persuasive interviewee
